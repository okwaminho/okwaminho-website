<h2 class="head"> BACKGROUND INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p class="body">
  The Kibos sugar and allied industries limited (KSAIL) was opened on 7th december, 2007. It’s owned by CHATTHE GROUP
  Kibos Sugar and Allied Industries is a sugar mill and factory located in Kisumu, Kenya with the capacity 3,000 tones
  crushed daily. The company depends on out-growers to supply the factory with sugarcane for crushing. Kibos Sugar and
  Allied Industries Limited locally produces sugar to meet the country’s needs which is currently being supplemented
  through importation due to inadequate local production. Currently the company is the single largest employer in the
  area and has a huge impact in the area through its sugar cane farmers out grower program which has increased the
  income levels of the community by providing them with an economically viable agricultural activity.</p>
  <p class="body"> The company
  employs more than a 1000 people. Kibos Sugar and Allied Industries is managed by Board of directors and owned by Mr.
  Jaspreet Singh Chatthe, Mr. Ragbhir Singh Chatthe and Mr. Sukhwinder Singh Chatthe. These three shareholders are
  seasoned entrepreneurs in the sugar business with their family being in the sugar business for over 70years.They have
  in the past engaged in the transport of sugar and more recently set up the ultra-modern sugar factory at Kibos with a
  crushing capacity of 1650TCD.Within 3years Kibos Sugar and Allied Industries Limited production reached close to 100%
  capacity utilization .The shareholders have a clear track record for successfully operating the sugar mill as
  indicated by the operating and financial performance of Kibos Sugar and Allied Industries Limited.</p>
  <p class="body">The vision of the
  company is to be a globally competitive and unsurpassed innovator and producer of high quality sugar and allied
  products. The main aim of the factory is to maintain a competitive advantage by economical pricing, state-of-the art
  technology and empowerment of it stakeholders through technology transfers, skills enhancement, knowledge, inspiration
  and motivation. The company core business is production of sugar for domestic as well as export use as required by
  customer demand. The company aspires to strengthen its commitment and partnerships so as to achieve and sustaSugar
  cane history Sugar is a sweet crystalline substance used as a sweetener in foods and drinks. It is a natural
  carbohydrate found in fruits and vegetables. Commercially its major sources are sugarcane and beet. Sugar is a broad
  term applied to a large number of carbohydrates present in many plants characterized by a more or less sweet taste.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="frame">
  <p class="body"> It
  is thought that cane sugar was first used by man in Polynesia from where it spread to India. In 510 BC the Emperor
  Darius of what was then Persia invaded India where he found "the reed which gives honey without bees". The secret of
  cane sugar, as with many other of man's discoveries, was kept a closely guarded secret whilst the finished product was
  exported for a rich profit. It was the major expansion of the Arab peoples in the seventh century AD that led to a
  breaking of the secret. When they invaded Persia in 642 AD they found sugar cane being grown and learnt how sugar was
  made. As their expansion continued they established sugar production in other lands that they conquered including
  North Africa and Spain. Sugar was only discovered by western Europeans as a result of the Crusades in the 11th Century
  AD. Crusaders returning home talked of this "new spice" and how pleasant it was.</p>
  <p class="body"> 
  The first sugar was recorded in
  England in 1099. The subsequent centuries saw a major expansion of western European trade with the East, including the
  importation of sugar. It is recorded, for instance, that sugar was available in London at "two shillings a pound" in
  1319 AD. This equates to about US$100 per kilo at today's prices so it was very much a luxury. In the 15th century AD,
  European sugar was refined in Venice, confirmation that even then when quantities were small, it was difficult to
  transport sugar as a food grade product. In the same century, Columbus sailed to the Americas, the "New World". It is
  recorded that in 1493 he took sugar cane plants to grow in the Caribbean. The climate there was so advantageous for
  the growth of the cane that an industry was quickly established. By 1750 there were 120 sugar refineries operating in
  Britain.</p>

  <img class="png" src="production flow chart.png" width="650" height="800">
  <h3 class="head">Weighbridge</h3> 
  <P class="body">A weighbridge is a large set of scales, usually mounted permanently on a concrete foundation that is used to weigh
  entire trucks and their contents. By weighing the truck both empty and when loaded, the load carried by the truck can
  be calculated. The key component that uses a weighbridge in order to make the weigh measurement is load cells. This is
  what is being used at Kibos weighbridge in order to determine the weight of the canes which has been received at the
  plant by various farmers since they are paid based on the tonnage of their product.</P> 
  <p class="body">
    The cane is next offloaded at the
  cane yard which is located at some few meters away from the weighbridge. It is recommended that sugar cane should not
  surpass a period of 1 week at the cane yard in order to avoid spoilage of the cane by the reduction of it sucrose
  content caused by various bacteria which attack the cane. The cane yard is formed of 4 overhead cranes, 3 feeder
  tables and 3 hydro unloaders. Overhead crane 1 feeds the main cane carrier with cane which will then be taken to the
  mills. Overhead crane 2 brings canes close to the main cane carrier and feeds Feeder table 2. Overhead crane 3 clears
  cane from hydro unloader 3 and feeds Feeder table 2. Overhead crane 5 clears remaining canes from tractors, trailers
  and Lorries. All along the cane carrier, we have choppers and levelers which cut and chop cane into pieces and kickers
  which kick unwanted materials such as stones, wood, and separate cane which is stuck together. The kickers detect
  unwanted materials. It produces a high sound when there's unwanted material passing through it. At the end of the cane
  carrier, we have a fibriser which hammers chopped cane before being taken to the mills. Fibriser breaks down the cane
  into fiber form. Rack carriers transport the cane fibers from fibriser to mill. </p> </div>
  <div class="frame">
  <h3 class="head"> Mill house</h3>
  <p class="body">
  The Kibos sugar and allied industries limited has 5 mills which have 5 rollers each; the 2 first rollers are called
  Top Roller Pressure feeder (TRPF) used to collect the cane fiber and transfer to the other 3 rollers; called top
  roller, feed roller and discharge roller. In between the mills, we have inter-carriers which transport Bagasse from
  one mill to another. Mill 1 and 5 are similar in shape and size and mills 2, 3 and 4 are as well similar but smaller
  in size than 1 and 5.</p>
  <p class="body"> 
    Juice collected from each mill is mixed with biocides before being taken to the mixed juices
  tank to inhibit the growth of bacteria during the milling process in sugar mills.</p>
  <h4 class=" head"> Advantages of biocides</h4> 
  <ol class="body">
   <li> Ready to
  use concentrated liquid</li>
  <li> Particularly effective against leuconostoe mesentroides</li>
  <li> Reduced purity drop from primary
  to mixed juice - Economical - Free from chlorine - Free from ammonium compounds.</li>
</ol>
  <p class="body"> 
    The Bagasse obtained at the last mill
  is taken to the boiler for steam generation after separating it with the Bagacillo. The separation of bagacillo from
  Bagasse is done through the carriers located after mill 5 which is made of a sieve which allows bagacillo to pass and
  lets the Bagasse pass on it way to the boiler section.</p>
 <p class="body">
  The juice from the mixed juice tank is pumped to the vapor line juice heater or to the dynamic heater where the
  temperature of the juice is raised to 60°C before being pumped to the juice heater one which raises as well the
  temperature of the juice at 70-72°C. The juice is then taken to the sulphitor tank where it's mixed with lime to boost
  the PH since the juice is acidic (~PH5).</p>
  <p class="body">
     The juice, through the action of gravity, is taken to the 1st stage limed
  juice tank where phosphoric acid is added to improve the color of the juice by forming a precipitate with the lime
  which can be easily removed from the juice. The juice gets out of the sulphitor with a PH of 7-8. The juice is pumped
  from the 1st stage limed juice tank to the top or lower Direct charge heater (DCH) which raises the temperature up to
  70-72°C since the temperature slightly dropped while passing through the sulphitor tank and the main objective raising
  the temperature at around 70°C is to kill bacteria, increase the rate of reaction of the formation, Temperature
  increases the rate of reaction as the molecules interact at an elevated energy and speed.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="frame">
  <p class="body">
    The juice is then taken to
  the 2nd stage limed juice tank where it's being pumped to Heater 3 or 4 which raises its temperature up to 103-107°C
  before being taken to the flash tank which will surely drop its temperature slightly. The main reason raising the
  temperature of the juice up to 103-107°C is that this temperature is suitable for flashing. The juice proceeds to the
  flash tank. A flash tank is an open tank exposed to the atmosphere at the top that helps in the rapid cooling of the
  juice.</p>
  <p class="body">
     The exposure of juice at 103ºC to the atmosphere rapidly cools it dropping the pressure and temperature which
  has the following effects:<ol class="body">
  <li> Bagacillo bursts</li>
  <li> Removal of incondensable gases i.e. insoluble gases</li>
  <li>  Homogenizing the
  temperature of juice to prevent convectional currents in the clarifier.</li>
</ol>
 </p>
 <p class="body"> From flash tank, it's transferred into the
  clarifier where flocculants are dosed to allow formation of flocs of insoluble salts while the juice is being stirred.
  The flash tank main purpose is to reduce the pressure at which the juice get in the clarifier and avoid interference
  during the clarification process whereby juice can get out of the clarifier before its mud has been settled if it get
  into the clarifier with a high pressure.</p>  <img class="png" src="mud mixer.png" width="400" height="250">
  <p class="body">The mud in the clarifier is taken to the mud tank before being taken to the
  mud mixer where it's mixed with the bagacillo to give it the required texture before being taken to the mud vacuum
  rotary filter which sucks the juice present in the mud by the means of lower and high vacuum. The mud vacuum filter is
  formed of 3 zones:<ol class="body">
   <li>picking zone where the drum picks the mud from it bottom side while rotating.-The second zone
  called drying zone where some hot water are sprinkle on it while the inside vacuum pipes are sucking the juice from
  it.</li>
  <li> The last zone is called discharge zone where the mud is removed from the rotary drum and disposed.</li>
</ol>
 </p> </div>
 <div class="frame">
 <img class="png" src="flash tank.png" alt="Flash tank" width="450" height="400">
  <p class="body"> The filtrate
  juice is taken back to the 1st stage limed juice tank via the filtrate tank. The clear juice from clarifier is taken
  to the juice heater 2 which raises it T°C to 110°C before being transferred to the evaporators. The hot juice now
  flows to the evaporators using the principle of multiple effect evaporation to achieve maximum concentration. The
  evaporation process is regarded as the basic method for production of concentrate because it can eliminate water in
  the best energy efficient manner. Further, through using higher temperatures or through allocating the liquid to a
  wider surface area, the process time can be lessened to a great extent.</p>
  <P class="body">
    The clear juice from the clarifier which has a
  brix ranging between 14-18°Brix is concentrated for the formation of crystal sugar to 60°Brix. At this level, it's
  called Syrup. Evaporators are formed of tubes where juice flows in from bottom to top where it's collected through a
  pipe to the next evaporator. Evaporators have a better condensate removal system and better steam economy and
  distribution.</P>
  <h3 class="head">Juice treatment</h3>
  <h4 class="head"> Juice heater</h4>
 <p class="body">
  This consists of a cylindrical shell (vertical) which contains tube plates at both ends. The shell is extended beyond
  the tube plate on both sides; the extended portions are divided into compartments by baffles. The first compartment by
  which the juice enters and the last compartment by which the juice goes out of the heater are located in the top upper
  recess (for vertical heaters) contains one pass. All other compartments provide for 2 passes; upward and downward. If
  there are ten tubes per pass there will be twenty tubes in each compartment: 10 for upward and 10 for downward flow.</p>
 <p class="body">
  The tubes are made of brass having composition: 70%copper, 29%zinc, 1%tin. The internal diameter is 42mm with
  thickness of 3mm. the length of the tubes is 4.5m. The incondensable gases are discharged in the atmosphere through an
  incondensable gas pipe which should have a diameter of 1 sq cm per 10sq cm. the steam/vapor condensed should be
  removed so that the entire heating surface is exposed to the heating medium. The condensate pipe should be so designed
  that the flow condensate does not exceed a speed of 1 meter/sec. when the heating medium is vapor there should be a
  condensate collection tank with vacuum equalize line to ensure smooth flow of condensate.</p> 
  <p class="body">
  Vapor/steam pipe
  should be so designed that the velocity of vapor does not exceed 30 m/sec. The heaters have headers on both sides.
  These are connected by a long tie rod thereby balancing the weights. Thus simple manipulation is sufficient to open
  both the covers.</p>

  <div class="frame">
  <h4 class="head"> clarifier</h4>
  <P class="body">
   The cane juice is constituted of <strong> 77-88% water, 8-21% sucrose, 0.3-3% reducing sugar, 0.5-1.0% other organic compounds
  and 0.2-0.6% inorganic compounds.</strong> In the sugarcane Sucrose, Glucose and Fructose.
   </p>
   <img class="png" src="sucrose structure.png" width="350" height="400">
   <p class="body">They are the main carbohydrate present.
  Sucrose is a disaccharide while glucose and fructose are mono saccharides. When sucrose undergoes inversion we get
  fructose and glucose: C12H22O11 + H2O = C6H12O6 + C6H12O6 In any cane juice clarification process we have to achieve
  the following objectives: <ol class="body">
    <li>Crystallize and bag as much sugar as possible</li>
    <li>Remove as much non sugars as possible</li> 
 <li>Avoid
  inversion of sugar as it means loss of crystalisable sugar</li>
  <li> Avoid destruction of reducing sugars Addition of lime
  and phosphoric acid precedes the clarification process.</li>
</ol>
</P>
  <p class="body">
    Lime is used to boost the PH of the juice. About 75-80% of
  phosphates present are extracted in juice. It has been established beyond doubt that phosphates play a very
  significant role in clarification. It’s the inorganic phosphate which reacts and helps in the clarification process.
  Normally, phosphate content in the clear juice is about 80-100mg/l. it has been found that juice that contains more
  phosphates clarifies better. Phosphates precipitates not only absorb the inorganic impurities but also improve the
  color of the clear juice. Mud settles faster and filters better. Viscosity of massecuite is also on the lower side
  when adequate phosphates are present in mixed juice. Other chemicals a part from phosphoric acid can be added such as
  Triple superphosphate, di and mono calcium phosphate.</P>
  <img class="png" src="clarifier.png" width="400" height="400">
 <h4 class="head"> Rotary continuous mud filter</h4>
  <p class="body"> Normally consists mainly of stainless steel drum rotating in its horizontal axis. The drum has usually a diameter of 2.44m
  or 3.05m. The length varies from 2.5 to 6 ft. The periphery of the drum is divided into 24 sections. Each section is
  connected to distributing valves by individual pipelines on either side of the drum. The high vacuum is of 15’ (375mm)
  Hg and low vacuum in the range of 5-6’ (125-150mm) Hg. The drum is partially submerged in a through containing mud
  mixed with bagacillo. On one side of the drum, water nozzles are provided along throughout the width of the drum.
  These nozzles spray water on the filter cake. At the top of the drum three or four drip pipes are provided. Through
  these drip pipes water falls on the drum by drop. On the other side of the drum a scraper plate is provided to scrape
  the filter cake adhering to the drum. The discharged cake falls on a belt conveyor and sent out.</p>
  <img class="png" src="vacuum filter.png" width="450" height="500"> </div>
  <div class="frame">
  <h3 class="head"> Multiple Effect Evaporators</h3>
 <p class="body"> An evaporator is of multiple effect type when juice in a vessel is boiled by virtue of the condensation of vapors
  derived from the boiling juice in a previous vessel. The juice in the first vessel is boiled by condensation of steam.
  The process is repeated in subsequent vessels. It will be observed that steam is limited to the requirement of first
  vessel only. The more vessels there are in the evaporator, greater the steam economy. The working of the evaporator is
  based on three principles: - In a multiple effect evaporator, for each pound of steam used, as many pounds of
  evaporation will result as there are units in the set. - If vapors are withdrawn from any unit of a multiple effect
  evaporator, to replace steam in a concurrent process, the saving in steam will be equal to the amount of vapor so used
  divided by the number of units in the set and multiplied by the sequence position of the unit from which the vapor has
  been withdrawn. - In any apparatus in which steam or vapor is condensed, it’s necessary continuously to withdraw the
  accumulation of non condensable gas which is unavoidably left in the heating surface compartment.</p>
  <p class="body">An evaporator
  consists of a vertical MS cylindrical body closed at the top by a dome and save all (or catches all). The bottom of
  the vessel has a saucer bottom. The heating is done in a calandria. This consists of two tubes plates. They are held
  in position by toe rods. There are a large number of tubes in the calandria. The two ends of the tubes are expanded to
  the two tube plates. The internal diameter of the tubes is generally 42mm. The juice/syrup will be inside the tubes.
  Heating steam or vapor is on the falls down in the same tube or in an adjacent tube. In the center of the calandria
  there is a tube of large diameter which is called a down take. The diameter of down take is 1/4 to 1/8 that of the
  diameter of the vessel. This does not play any role in heating the juice. This helps in circulation of juice. The down
  take may be open, semi sealed or sealed. If the evaporator has open or semi sealed down take a part of the case of and
  sealed down take, the entire juice entering the down take will go to the next body. The vertical side of the calandria
  may either form an integral part of the sides or the calandria may be floating. In floating calandria, there is space
  between the calandria and the vertical side of the vessel. Above the calandria the vapor space which extends up to the
  dome at a convenient height to watch the boiling inside the body.</p>
  <p class="body">In the dome there is a save all to arrest the juice
  which may be carried over with vapors. The space between the bottom tube plate and the bottom saucer is called the
  liquor space. There's a manhole in the saucer. This is used for entering the bottom saucer for replacing a damaged
  tube. The entire vessel is lagged to reduce loss of heat due to radiation. The calandria of the first body is heated
  by exhaust steam. The vapor space of the first body is connected by a vapor pipe to the calandria of the next body to
  supply it with vapors from the boiling juice. Similarly, vapor space from the second and third bodies supply vapors to
  third and fourth bodies respectively. In case of a quadruple effect evaporator, the vapor from the fourth body is
  connected to the condenser.</p> </div>
  <div class="frame">
  <h3 class="head"> SEMI-KESTNER</h3>
  <p class="body">Paul Kestner French engineer designed evaporators with ling tubes. His design
  had very long tubes and worked on the principle of climbing film. When a liquid is heated in a very long tube, the
  vapor bubbles which form at the base of the tube increase in size as they rise and their diameter rapidly attains that
  of the tube. From then on, the upper part of the tube is traversed only by, first a chain of bubbles, then a thin
  layer of bubbles, then a film of juice, against the tube, entrained by the friction of the upward current of vapor.</p>
  <img class="png" src="sk evaporator.png" width="400" height="400">
  <h3 class="head"> Pan boiling</h3>
 <p class="body"> Pan boiling is an operation of managing the vacuum apparatus that crystallizes sugar. The main purpose of pan boiling
  is growing the sugar crystals to the required market size. There are three types of pan boiling namely.
  <ol class="body">
    
  <li>A sugar
  boiling</li>
  <li> B sugar boiling</li> 
  <li> C sugar boiling.</li>
</ol>
 </p>
 <p class="body"> Massecuite
  refers to a component of mother liquor (molasses) and sugar crystals. The A massecuite is pumped into the high grade
  centrifuges. Wash water is then flashed in to wash the molasses and the impurities. The larger crystals cannot pass
  through the centrifuges pores. The basket then opens and wet A sugar flows out. The sugar flows to the driers. The A
  molasses which has a 70-76 purity and 70-75 brix is used in B boiling to exhaust the sucrose content in syrup. Brix
  refers to the percentage by mass of total soluble solids of a pure aqueous sucrose solution. A sugar crystal has a
  length ranging from 0.5-0.7mm. At the centrifuges, they rotate at 1450 rev/min and separate A massecuite into A-sugar
  and A molasses (heavy and light). Wash water reduces viscosity so that molasses flows easily and also eases the
  separation of molasses and crystals.</p>
  <p class="body">
    B sugar boiling B sugar comes from B boiling. B sugar is got from A molasses. A
  molasses is used to boil B sugar to get B massecuite. B massecuite has a 70-76 purity and brix level of 94-95. The B
  massecuite is then pumped into the continuous high grade centrifuges, here steam is sprayed on the basket and the
  massecuite is let in as it continuously separates sugar and molasses. B sugar and B molasses are separated. B sugar
  crystals are finer 0.2-0.5mm in length and are not the required market size. Water is added for movement and magma is
  formed. The B magma is pumped into the magma receiver from where it is injected into the A massecuite. Here it is used
  as a seed for A sugar. It is dissolved with hot water so that it dissolves completely and bigger crystals are
  obtained. When it achieves 100 dissolution it is cut across the other pan in order to get good crystal size. Finer
  crystals grow in pan A as a result of granulation. Granulation is the growing of crystals by feeding of syrup on the
  nuclei. B sugar acts as the nuclei. Treated syrup is fed on the B crystals that are in the B crystals that are in the
  B magma and crystals that grow lead to the formation of A massecuite and the process repeats itself. The nucleus is
  called slurry. Sugar is always formed from slurry. This is when the plant is starting up in the boiling process but as
  we proceed the seed are usually B sugar and C sugar.</p> </div>
  <div class="frame">
  <p class="body">
     C sugar boiling C grain is first obtained by boiling A heavy
  molasses with B heavy molasses in the batch pan to get C grain which is stored in the C vacuum crystallizer before
  being taken in a continuous way to the continuous pan where it's boiled with A heavy molasses to give C massecuite
  which will be separated in continuous centrifugal machines into C sugar and C molasses. Hot water at 65ºC is added to
  the C sugar to make C melt which is recycled with raw syrup at B boiling. Vacuum activates the boiling pan circulation
  and controls the temperature to prevent caramelisation of sugar.</p>
  <h4 class="head"> Vacuum Pan</h4>
  <p class="body"> In batch pans, in order for circulation to occur, it is necessary before boiling to fill the pan to cover the top of
  the tubes. During boiling, the massecuite level reaches about 1500 to 2100 mm above the top tube plate, creating a
  high hydrostatic head and causing elevation of boiling point. This in turn lowers the differential temperature between
  the massecuite and the calandria steam and increases the likelihood of color formation. The final head above the top
  tube plate is a function of the tube length.</p>
  <p class="body">
    In general, wide short-tube calandria require less additional head than
  long-tube calandria. Although circulation is promoted by vapor bubbles within the tubes, their effect is dispersed in
  the open volume above the tubes. Indeed, with high hydrostatic heads towards the end of boiling, the vapor bubbles may
  only form in a zone above the top tube plate. As a result, short-tube calandria circulate better than long-tube
  calandria during the latter stages of boiling, particularly in the absence of stirring. For this reason, tube length
  is critical in the design of batch pans, with good designs featuring tube lengths between 800 – 1200 mm.</p>
  <img class="png" src="batch pan.png" width="400" height="400"> </div>
  <div class="frame">
  <h4 class="head"> Continuous vacuum pan</h4>
  <p class="body">
    The impact of tube length in continuous vacuum pans is very different. The massecuite level is constant from the first
  stages to the last (typically about 300 mm above the top tube plate). There is minimal hydrostatic head at the top of
  the tubes and the delta-T between the calandria steam and the massecuite is not suppressed, which allows for the use
  of lower pressure / temperature steam. Continuous pans generally exhibit good circulation with a relatively high
  proportion of vapor in the tubes, ultimately lowering effective pressure, even at the bottom of the tubes. Because of
  this, tube length has very little impact on heat transfer and color formation in CVPs.</p>
  <img class="png" src="continuous pan.png" width="400" height="400">
 <h4 class="head"> Continuous Centrifugal machines.</h4> 
  <p class="body"> The centrifugal force is directly proportional to the mass of the rotating body and to the square of the peripheral
  speed and inversely proportional to the radius of rotation. G= (D×N2)/ 1800 where G = centrifugal force D= diameter in
  meters N =RPM Based on this principle, centrifugal machines are used to separate mother liquor (molasses) from
  crystals in the massecuite. A. Batch centrifugal machine; consists of a shaft connected to the drive at one end and to
  a cylindrical basket through a spider. On both ends of the basket annular rings are provided. The top opening
  facilitates charging of massecuite while the bottom opening is utilized for discharging the sugar. The bottom opening
  is closed by a sheet cone to ensure that the massecuite does not fall at the time of charging, on to the grass hopper
  conveyor below. The basket and shaft are suspended in a housing which contains radial and thrust bearings.</p>
  <p class="body">
  This
  housing has a connoidal rubber buffer which allows slight oscillation. The interior of the basket is made smooth. The
  Centrifugal basket has holes through which the molasses drains out. The holes are of about 6mm diameter and spaced at
  about 22mm distance between centers. Thickness of the basket depends on the RPM. In some cases hoops are provided to
  give strength to the basket. In modern centrifugal, special alloys are used and in most of the cases hoops are not
  required. The thickness of the basket is as much as 13mm. The basket is provided with two linings; woven gauze of
  brass or copper wire of 0.75-1.5mm diameter with openings of 5-10 mm serves to separate the perforated liner from the
  basket. The machine is started and when the speed is about 150-200 RPM the charging door of the pug mill is opened by
  a pneumatically operated valve.</p>
  <p class="body"> Massecuite starts flowing into the basket. The massecuite falls on the sheet cone and
  rebounds to the rotating surface of the basket. Due to centrifugal force the massecuite gets stuck to the basket.
  Automatic centrifugals have a sensor in the basket to stop the charging door as soon as the required level of
  massecuite is charged. In some machines the operator visually observes the level and closes the charging door. After
  the charging is over the Centrifugal accelerates and attains its full speed.</p>
  <img class="png" src="batch centrifugal machine.png" width="400" height="400">
  <p class="body"> Continuous centrifugal
  machine consist of a conical shaped vertical basket driven by electric motor with suitable sized pulleys. The cone has
  an angle of 25-34°. The basket rotates at 1200-2200 RPM and develops a centrifugal force of 2000g. </p>
  <p class="body">
  The basket has a
  backing screen and perforated liner. The massecuite enters the centrifugal through a distributor at the center of the
  basket. The massecuite is thrown towards the periphery due to centrifugal force. As the massecuite climbs up the
  basket the crystal and molasses get separated; the molasses will be passing through the liner and hugging the basket
  while the crystals move up on the liner itself as it cannot move up. The molasses acts as a lubricant and reduces the
  abrasive action of the liner on sugar crystal. A small quantity of water is sprayed to wash the film of molasses on
  sugar crystals. As the sugar and molasses move up they encounter higher and higher centrifugal force due to larger
  diameter. Just before the periphery of the basket, there are openings for the escape of molasses. This is ultimately
  drained into a tank at the back of the centrifugal. The sugar is thrown tangentially outside and hits the monitor
  casing. Thereafter it falls down through a wide chute into the magma mixer below the Centrifugal. The perforated
  liners are divided into four sections and are to be fitted in a proper way.</p>
  <p class="body">The vertical crystallizer acts as a temporary store for the C massecuite after it is drpped from the
     continuous pan. 
     It is graduated with a stirrer to ensure that the massecuite flows in to the pug mill of the centrifugal machine
     with the aid of hot water that flows into the crystallizer. </p>

 <h3 class="head">Grasshopper conveyor.</h3>
 <p class="body">
  It's used for moving sugar towards drier. This consists of trapezoidal shaped trough of light galvanized. This is
  reinforced by angle irons and supported on wooden strips acting as springs. The wooden strips are mounted at about 60°
  angle with horizontal base. A connecting rod, made of wood with crank pin head conveys a shaking movement to the
  trough. The horizontal movement will be about 35 to 40 mm on an average. When sugar is discharged on the grass hopper
  conveyor, it will fall in a heap. Due to the reciprocating movement of the conveyor, the upper layers of crystals have
  a higher acceleration than lower ones and in this way in a short time the entire sugar is distributed uniformly over
  the entire conveyor. The length of conveyor will depend upon the local conditions.  This is a very convenient method of
  transporting moist sugar.</p>
   <h4 class="head"> Sugar drying</h4>
   <p class="body">
  Sugar leaving the A centrifuges has a moisture content of 0.5-2%. This
  quantity of moisture although small has an extremely detrimental effect on keeping the quality of raw sugar.
  Deterioration takes place mainly in the moisture in the molasses film around the crystals and drying is therefore
  important for easier handling in the packaging section, for preservation purposes, for easier selection of wanted
  crystal size. The drier is mounted with choke to detect finer crystals. Finer crystals are returned to raw syrup tank.
  The equipment used is the rotary Louvre drier. This is a rotary drum set horizontally with a tilt towards the
  discharge end and through which sugar passes in counter current fashion with hot air. The hot air drawn in through the
  drum provides enough heat to evaporate off the water vapor. When sugar is lifted by the scoops, it falls down a little
  way further from feed because of the tilting of the drum. In this way it moves to the discharge end. Air is filtered
  to remove dust particles.</p>
  <img class="png" src="dryer.png" width="400" height="250">
 <h4 class="head">Sugar grading.</h4>
  <P class="body">Though the sugar coming from drier has been dried and most of it dust blown away, there's still few amount of dust
  remaining in the sugar as well as solid block of sugar which shouldn't appear in the final product. The sugar grader
  is formed of 6 sieves with the top sieve having bigger screens while the last one having smaller screens. As the sugar
  get in from the top sieve, due to the vibration, it passes through the screens while block of sugar don't and are
  collected through the rejected sugar pipes (2). The sugar does move from the top screens to the bottom screens until
  it reaches the last screens which do not allow sugar to pass but only sugar dust which is also collected through the
  sugar dust pipe and taken to the old melter before being taken back to the syrup boxes. The sugar free from dust is
  then taken to the sugar bin which is a huge, metallic storage tank. From the bin, sugar is bagged in 25 and 50 kgs
  bags as well as in 250g, and 1kg, 2kg and 5 kg bags.</P>
 <h3 class="head">Laboratory.</h3>
 <p class="body">The laboratory is one of the most important places in a Sugar plant. Laboratory testing is an important process, which
  relies on scientific analysis to identify problems with sugar products. It provides analytical data on the quality of
  a product (juice, syrup or massecuite etc) to support quality control. The objective of quality control is to identify
  contaminants in raw material, or contamination after a product is produced and before it is placed on the market. As
  well as to check if the material being tested meet all the standards set by the laboratory. Kibos Sugar Laboratory is
  committed to continual improvement of processes and services to achieve ongoing customer satisfaction. To be able to
  achieve this, the laboratory has developed the following quality objectives:</p> </div>

 </ol>
 <p class="body"> Here are the analyses conducted in the laboratory:</p>
 <h4 class="head">1.Special Analysis.</h4>
  <p class="body">Mainly conducted on request and are done once in a while. They are as well conducted when the lab analyst feels like
  there's something wrong about the results obtained from the routine analysis.</p> </div>
  <div class="frame">
 <h4 class="head">2. Routine analysis</h4>
 <p class="body">
  These are hourly and daily test performed at the plant. They are as important as the special ones. Procedure of analyses 1.
  Brix It's the percent by weight of solid matter in a sample. Here is how it's done in the laboratory: -A sample is
  collected (juice from the mill house, syrup, massecuite, molasses, etc.) - 50g of the sample is weighed on a weighing
  balance and 450 ml of distilled water is added to it. The mixture is vigorously stirred until a homogeneous solution
  is obtained. - The solution is taken to a graduated cylinder where a brix spindle hydrometer is introduced and gives
  the brix reading as well as the temperature of the sample.</p>
 <p class="body">The corrected brix is obtained using the Schmitz
  Conversion Table. E.g. the brix Spindle hydrometer reading is 8.5 at 27°C. Corrected brix is obtained by subtracting
  if temperature is below 27.5°C or adding if the temperature is above 27.5°C the value obtained in the Schmitz
  Conversion Table from the Brix reading ( 8.5-0.04= 8.46) 2. Pol -From the same sample prepared to obtain Brix, 200 ml
  is taken and poured in a beaker and mixed with around 7-8g or 2 spatulas of dry lead acetate which main purpose is to
  ease the filtration process since the sample such as massecuite and molasses are heavy and sticky and might not filter
  if they are not diluted. Lead acetate does provide as well clarity to the sample, making it easy for the Saccharimeter
  or polarimeter to read the sample.</p>
  <p class="body">The solution is stirred vigorously with lead to obtain a homogeneous solution. By
  the use of funnel, a conical flask and a filter paper, the sample is filtered and a clear filtrate is obtained. - A
  pol tube is filled of the filtrate and bubbles are removed from it before being placed in the polarimeter which gives
  the pol reading or the sucrose content of the sample. - the pol reading is as well corrected according to the
  Schmitz’s Table for use in Horne's Dry Lead method and in polarizing undiluted solution for brix Spindle standardized
  at 27.5°C. E.g. °Brix = 8.46 pol reading = 10.3(0.3=0.07) percent pol (%pol) = 2.53+0.07= 2.6. Finally, purity is
  obtained by dividing the %pol by °Brix and multiply by a 100 :( %pol/°Brix)*100. The results obtained from the Brix and
  pol test should fall within the range of the standards set by the laboratory which may slightly differ from a
  laboratory to another. If it fails to fall within the range, corrective measures should be taken and the various
  reason for why it does not meet the standards might be mechanical or operation problems, quality of the raw materials
  used (cane), the boiling temperature which is not met, and the standard conditions of boiling such as low or high
  steam, few or more water.</p>
 <h4 class="head">3.Test on sugar cane juice</h4>
  <p class="body">Canes received at the plant are taken through various analyses before they can be crushed
  to produce sugar. Among these tests, we've the amount of solid matter in the cane juice, sucrose content and purity of
  the juice. Procedure A representative number of canes which can be around 5 canes are taken from each lorry
  transporting cane, they are weighed, trash is removed and weighed as well, then crushed in a laboratory cane crusher
  and the juice collected in plastic containers and weighed too. This helps to know the percent of juice, trash and
  Bagasse from the canes. 200 ml of cane juice is mixed with 1-2g of lead acetate, it’s filtered and the filtrate is
  taken to the polarimeter to obtain it sucrose content. A portable refractometer is used to determine the brix of the
  cane juice.</p> </div>
  <div class="frame">
 <h4 class="head">4.Test on the Preparation Index PI (POL METHOD)</h4>
 <p class="body">This is the percent ratio of Pol leached out of the open cells of
  prepared cane to the pol of disintegrated cane under specified condition. Procedure -500g of Bagasse was mixed with 3
  liters of water and the mixture was manually vigorously stirred for 1 hour. A portion was taken from it and pol
  reading was 8.0 -A second sample was as well prepared; 1000g Bagasse mixed with 5 liters of water. The sample was
  taken to the disintegrator for 1 hour and pol obtained was 3.0. The ratio was obtained: r=P1/P2=3/8= 0.375 K or PI =
  1000r/3.228-0.838r= 5. %pol Bagasse determination This determines the amount of sucrose lost in the Bagasse. The lower
  it's, the better. A high amount of sucrose in Bagasse represents a loss to the company and formation of carbon block
  in the boiler.</p>
  <P class="body"> Procedure:250g of Bagasse mixed to 2liters of water is disintegrated, filtered and pol reading obtained
  from the polarimeter. From the same sample of Bagasse, around 100g is taken to the oven to determine the moisture
  content. The moisture percent obtained is taken to the Bagasse moisture factor table which gives the Bagasse moisture
  factor based on the moisture percent. Formula %pol Bagasse= pol reading×2(constant) ×Bagasse moisture factor.</P>
  <h4 class="head"> 5.Reducing sugar</h4>
  <p class="body"> It's the reducing substances in cane or its products calculated as invert sugar. Procedure 5ml of
  Fehling’s A is mixed with 5ml Fehling’s B and 15 to 20 ml of distilled water. The mixture is heated to boiling point
  before being titrated against the sample (clear juice, mixed juice) in the burette. Methyl blue is uses as indicator.
  Examples: Sample A B C D Volume mixed juice 5.8 5.9 6.0 5.3 Formula: Reducing sugar RS= (5.128× 100)/°Brix × titer For
  diluted sample RS= (5.128×100)/°Brix × Dilution factor× titer.
  <h4 class="head"> 6. Determination of CaO in Ca (OH)2</h4>
  <p class="body">Procedure (sucrose
  method) 5g of lime (Ca (OH) 2) is mixed with 75 to 90ml of boiled distilled water in a 250ml volumetric flask. The
  mixture is heated at boiling point. It's cooled on a cold water bath before adding to it a solution of 40 to 45 g of
  pure sugar and 40ml of boiled distilled water. The mixture is vigorously mixed for 30 min then filtered. 25 ml of the
  filtrate is placed in a cleaned 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask. 5 drops of phenolphthalein are added as indicator and
  titration start to the absence of pink color with 0.357N H2SO4.
  % Available CaO = volume in ml of 0.357N H2SO4 used in the titration×2.</p> </div>
  <div class="frame">
  <h3 class="head"> WATER TREATMENT PLANT[WTP]</h3>
 <p class="body">In order to process one ton of sugarcane, the sugar mill needs about 2 m3 of water and produces 0.4 m3 of wastewater.
  From this data, we can conclude that with the approximate 3000 tons of cane crushed on a daily basis, Kibos does
  utilize around 6000 m3 of water and produces 1200 m3 of waste water. The boiler as well uses tremendous amount of
  water which is being heated to produce steam to run the turbine and produce electricity and steam to the plant. These
  are huge volume water hence the need of a water treatment plant is eminent. Kibos sugar and allied industries limited
  is strategically located along River Kibos whose water is utilized for the various activities in the sugar plant.
  Water at Kibos Sugar is mainly treated for 2 purposes; for boiler and for consumption at the plant.</p>
 <h4 class="head">1.De-mineralized water</h4>
 <p class="body"> Water from Kibos River is pumped to the storage and settling tanks which are important in case
  the river is contaminated or in case the water level at the river goes down. Water at this stage is given time to
  settle before being pumped to the Clarifier where Caustic Soda is added, alum and polyelectrolyte. It goes next to the
  storage tank where a part of it is taken to the multi-grade filter (containing from bottom to top Gravel, marble
  chips, corse sand and fine sand) and the softener tank which is formed of resin which attract minerals present in
  water. This resin is regenerated by adding NaCl to it which removes all minerals fixed to the resin. The water
  softened is finally sent to the cooling tower to be used at the turbine. Another part of the water in the storage tank
  goes to the filter tank in which it passes through sand which retains solid particles present in water. This sand is
  washed with caustic soda once every 3 months to insure it's always clean.</p>
  <p class="body">Filtered water goes next to the
  ultra-filters on it way to the ultra-filters tank. It's taken to the Reverse Osmosis. The reverse osmosis are cleaned
  using solution of Sodium Meta-bisulphate (SMBS) and anti-scalant then stored in the Reverse osmosis tank. It's taken
  from there to the mixed bed which contains resin (formed of cat ions and anions) which removes minerals in water. This
  water is then taken to the blue storage tank. NB: water from the Reverse Osmosis on it way to the Reverse Osmosis tank
  is degassed. Let note that HCl and NaOH are added to the mixed bed to insure neutrality between cat ions and anions in
  the resin. From the blue storage tank, water goes to the dual medium filter (DMF) before being taken to the Activate
  Carbon Filter which removes excess chlorine. It’s next taken to the Strong Acid cation where positive resins are
  added to neutralize negative ions of water. The resins are regenerated with HCl. Next, water is taken to the digester
  tank and it’s aerated with blown air to remove carbonic gases in water which is harmful to the boiler. Water is then
  taken to the Strong Base Anion tank containing negative resins to neutralize all positive ions in water. These resins
  are regenerated by the use of caustic soda. It’s been taken next to the Mixed Bed containing neutral resins to remove
  remaining anions and cat-ions before being taken to the final storage tank.</p>
 <h4 class="head"> 2.Drinking water</h4>
 <p class="body">The treatment From the dirty water storage tank, water is pumped to a different clarifier where Alum is
  added to allow coagulation of solid particles present in water. Alum acidifies water, reason why lime is added to
  regulate the PH to 7-7.5. Polyelectrolyte is also added to allow flocculation to tale place through which flocs are
  formed and settle at the bottom of the clarifier tank. Chlorine is also added in form of Calcium Hypochlorite (CaOCl)
  to insure that bacteria are eliminated in the water. The clear water obtained is then stored in an open storage tank
  where PH is constantly checked and should be neutral (~7-8)before being pumped to the dual medium filter tank which is
  formed of stones, sand and fine sands which retain solid particles and all impurities. The stones and sand are washed
  daily (once a shift, i.e. 3 times daily) through a process called back washing i.e. water passes through the tank from
  the bottom of the tank picking all impurities present;The sand and stones and remove them from the top pipe. It's
  rinsed as well by passing water from top to bottom. Filtered water goes then to the carbon filter tanks containing
  carbon crystals which mainly removes undesirable odor in the water before it goes to the final storage tank and ready
  for use.</p> </div>
  <div class="frame">
  <img class="png" src="drinking water treatment.png" width="400" height="400">
  <h3 class="head">Boiler.</h3>
  <p class="body">Turbine section Kibos sugar has a capacity of producing 100T/hr of steam and has a heating capacity that goes up to
  1000°C. A boiler is primordial to a sugar plant as it main source of energy. Treated water stored in a storage tank
  near the boiler is at PH 7.5-9. This water should be at bit basic 9.5-10 to avoid corrosion of metallic pipes. It
  shouldn't be too basic as well (>11) because it'll form foam and it'll affect boiling point by rising it. So, a PH
  booster called Tri-sodium Phosphate or Indium 11-50 is used for that purpose. The choice of these chemicals is
  important to prevent metal corrosion (caustic soda is not used because it corrodes metals).</p>
  <p class="body">The water from the storage
  tank is pumped to the feed tank which is then transferred to the de-aerator by the help of gravity. In the de-aerator,
  oxygen is removed from the solution because it does cause pitting of the metal and corrosion of the metal and prevent
  formation of ozone gas 03. The removal of oxygen is done by mechanical and chemical means. By mechanical mean, steam
  is induced in the de aerator. It's proven that the solubility of gases decreases when there's increase in temperature
  and pressure allowing gas to escape. By chemical mean, oxygen scavenger (2liters) is added to the water in the de
  aerator. It's pumped using feed pump to the boiler economizer. It's intercepted on it way by a solution of TSP or
  indium 11-50 to boost the PH by the mean of High Pressure (HP) pump.</p>
  <p class="body">In the boiler economizer made of a coil kind of
  which brings the flu gases (ash, Bagasse...) which come at a very high temperature (650-700°C) heat the water by heat
  exchange mechanism. This water is then taken to the steam drum which steam produced goes to the steam line and water
  remaining goes to the header ( Store) before heading to the tubes (riser) in the furnace where water is transformed
  into vapor due to high T°C ( 600-800). This vapor goes next to the boiler economizer before going to the steam drum
  again which has 2 vents preventing formation of a vacuum. The steam in the steam line goes to the turbine to generate
  electricity but since the turbine needs a dry steam, a Pressure Reducing Di-super heating Station dries the steam
  before being taken to the turbine. At the turbine, steam is received in steam header which distributes steam as
  follow; 1kg to the process (evaporator, and pan), 7kg as well to the process smaller pipe mainly used in steaming the
  calandria and steam washing of the pan body and 45kg to the turbine where steam get into the turbine which turns at a
  speed of 6850rpm and the exhausted steam is sucked and condensed. Steam proceeds to the High Speed cobbling which
  rotates also at 6850rpm before bring taken to the gear box which reduces that speed to 1500rpm before being taken to
  the Low Speed Cobbling which maintains it at 1500rpm on it way to the Power Alternator which produces 11 KVA. It has 2
  terminals called the rotary part or light arrestor and the stationary part and takes it to the main breaker vacuum
  circuit breaker before being taken to the step down transformas which step it down to 450V.</p>
  <h3 class="head"> WASTE MANAGEMENT</h3>
 <h4 class="head">Water Effluent Treatment.</h4>
  <P class="body">Industrial pollution has been and continues to be a major threat to the environment affecting the water we use, the
  air we breathe and the soil we live on. Sugar industries are one of the biggest pollutant industries. Environmental
  pollution has been recognized as one of the major problems of the modern world. The problem of environmental pollution
  on account of essential industrial growth is practical terms, the problem of disposal of industrial water, whether
  solid, liquid or gaseous. All three types of wastes have the potentially of ultimately polluting water. It's in this
  line that Kibos sugar does treat its used water before discharging it back to the river. Waste water is collected in a
  collection chamber with an oil schemer which removes oil from water and some others which were not captured by the oil
  schemer are removed by physical mean using a paddle. At this level, the water is very acidic (PH4). On it way to the
  storage or receiver tank, a solution of lime is added to it to insure that the PH goes high to neutral (of pH neutral,
  no need to add more lime).</P>
  <p class="body">
    A solution of Alum is as well added to the waste water to ensure coagulation in the
  receiver tank takes place. Here, the solid particles settle down the tank before being pumped to the suction tank
  where only clear water is pumped and sludge remains in the receiver tank. Thank to 2 sludge lumps, the clear water in
  the suction tank is taken to the primary clarifier tank to further the clarification process. The same mechanism takes
  place in this clarifier as in the clarifiers used in the water treatment section. The settled sludge in the primary
  clarifier is blown down to the drying bed which is formed of sand allowing the liquid to pass and to go back to the
  receiver tank while the solid part remains. The clear water goes next to the primary aeration tank where Urea and DAP
  and sometimes cow dung is added to keep all aerobic bacteria alive and oxygen is blown into water to insure that all
  anaerobic bacteria are eliminated.</p>
  <p class="body">
     Water goes next to the secondary aeration tank where same reaction as in the
  primary aeration tank takes place via the biomass tank where settling of some sludge which escapes from the primary
  clarifier takes place. The settling sludge is pumped back to the primary aeration tank through a sludge pump. From the
  Second aeration tank, water goes to the Tertiary tank which act as a storage tank before being taken to the secondary
  clarifier where chlorine is added (3kg/day) to insure that all bacteria including the aerobic bacteria are dead before
  being taken to the storage tank. From the secondary clarifier to the storage tank before being taken to the ultra
  filters tube then to the reverse osmosis but currently, it goes directly to the filter tank made of Sand, stones and
  charcoal ( carbon) before being taken to the 2° filter tank where it comes out on it way to the river with a ph of
  8.5.</p>
 <h3 class="head">Solid Waste Management.</h3>
 <p class="body">Produces tremendous amount of solid waste which has to be treated or utilized effectively in order to prevent
  environmental degradation and pollution. The juice clarifier does produce a lot of mud which are taken to farms and
  used as fertilizer, the ashes are captured by the Electrostatic Precipitator and let only or harmless smokes escape in
  the atmosphere.</p> </div>
  <div class="frame">
 <h3 class="head">Conclusion and Recommendation. </h3>
 <h4 class="head">1.Chemical oxygen demand (COD) and Biological oxygen demand (BOD)</h4>
 <p class="body">
  At the Kibos Sugar water treatment plant, the flow of water from the Kibos River is continuous making it a bit challenging
  when dosing the chemicals in the clarifier. It’s easy to monitor the dosing of Lime and Alum since PH is constantly
  checked, but chlorine manual addition present some challenges since it only depends on the experience of the worker on
  how he finds the water to be more or less dirty. This makes it hard to quantify the exact amount of chlorine to be
  added, it might be excess or less. I recommend that COD and BOD test should be conducted as well as excess chlorine
  test in water. The tests will give to operators an idea about the amount of chlorine to be added to water based on
  flow of water in the clarifier.</p> 
 <h4 class="head"> 2.Heavy metals test</h4> 
 <p class="body">
  The pure sugar before bagging passes through some magnet to
  attract or retain possible metals present in the sugar. It’s obvious that all the metals are not totally removed; I
  suggest that a test on heavy metals in sugar should be conducted to know at which extent heavy metals are present in
  the pure sugar. This test will surely guide the operators and managers on how to improve the quality of sugar
  produced.</p>
  <h4 class="head"> 3.Insulation of calandria condensate pipes and the vapor pipe</h4>
  <p class="body"> The pan section is one of the hottest places
  in a sugar plant making it challenging to the employees working there. I believe insulating the calandria condensate
  pipe will decrease the temperature at the pan section making it convenient for the workers.</p>
